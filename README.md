Case Study #1 - Danny's Diner

### What is the 8 Week SQL Challenge?
   The 8-week SQL challenge is a program that helps improve SQL skills through real-world problem-solving. It offers weekly challenges to enhance query writing abilities and provides a supportive community. It's an ideal opportunity to strengthen SQL skills in a structured and engaging manner.

### Project Overview:
Danny seriously loves Japanese food so in the beginning of 2021, he decides to embark upon a risky venture and opens up a cute little restaurant that sells his 3 favourite foods: sushi, curry and ramen.

Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money theyâ€™ve spent and also which menu items are their favourite. Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better and more personalised experience for his loyal customers.

### Case Study Questions

1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?

```sql
SELECT
      dannys_diner.sales.customer_id,sum(dannys_diner.menu.price) as total_amount
FROM dannys_diner.sales
join dannys_diner.menu
on dannys_diner.sales.product_id=dannys_diner.menu.product_id
group by dannys_diner.sales.customer_id;
```

2. How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?

```sql
SELECT
      dannys_diner.sales.customer_id,count(distinct dannys_diner.sales.order_date) as customer_total_days
FROM dannys_diner.sales
group by dannys_diner.sales.customer_id;
```

3. What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?

```sql
select
customer_id,
STRING_AGG(distinct sub.product_name, ', ') AS aggregated_product_names
from
(SELECT
      customer_id,order_date,product_name,
    RANK () OVER (
      partition by customer_id
        ORDER BY order_date asc
    ) rank
FROM dannys_diner.sales
inner join dannys_diner.menu
on dannys_diner.sales.product_id=dannys_diner.menu.product_id
order by dannys_diner.sales.customer_id,dannys_diner.sales.order_date) as sub
where sub.rank=1
group by customer_id;
```

4. What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?

```sql
SELECT
      product_name,count(*) as purchased_times
FROM dannys_diner.sales
inner join dannys_diner.menu
on dannys_diner.sales.product_id=dannys_diner.menu.product_id
group by dannys_diner.sales.product_id,dannys_diner.menu.product_name
order by purchased_times desc
limit 1;
```

5. Which item was the most popular for each customer?

```sql
select
sub2.customer_id,
STRING_AGG(sub2.product_name, ', ') AS popular_item
from
(select
sub.*,
    RANK () OVER (
      partition by sub.customer_id
        ORDER BY sub.count desc
    ) as rank
from
(SELECT
  customer_id,dannys_diner.menu.product_name,count(*)
FROM dannys_diner.sales
inner join dannys_diner.menu
on dannys_diner.sales.product_id=dannys_diner.menu.product_id
group by customer_id,dannys_diner.sales.product_id,dannys_diner.menu.product_name
order by customer_id,dannys_diner.sales.product_id) as sub
) as sub2
where sub2.rank=1
group by sub2.customer_id;
```

6. Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?

```sql
select
sub.customer_id,
sub.order_date,
dannys_diner.menu.product_name
from
(SELECT
  dannys_diner.sales.customer_id,
  dannys_diner.sales.order_date,
  dannys_diner.sales.product_id,
      RANK () OVER (
      partition by dannys_diner.sales.customer_id
        ORDER BY dannys_diner.sales.order_date asc
    ) as rank
FROM dannys_diner.sales
inner join dannys_diner.members
on dannys_diner.sales.customer_id=dannys_diner.members.customer_id
and dannys_diner.sales.order_date>=dannys_diner.members.join_date
order by dannys_diner.sales.customer_id,dannys_diner.sales.order_date asc
) as sub
inner join dannys_diner.menu
on sub.product_id=dannys_diner.menu.product_id
where sub.rank=1;
```

7. Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?

```sql
select
sub.customer_id,
sub.order_date,
-- dannys_diner.menu.product_name,
STRING_AGG(distinct dannys_diner.menu.product_name, ', ') AS aggregated_product_names
from
(SELECT
  dannys_diner.sales.customer_id,
  dannys_diner.sales.order_date,
  dannys_diner.sales.product_id
  ,
    RANK () OVER (
    partition by dannys_diner.sales.customer_id
        ORDER BY dannys_diner.sales.order_date desc
    ) as rank
FROM dannys_diner.sales
inner join dannys_diner.members
on dannys_diner.sales.customer_id=dannys_diner.members.customer_id
and dannys_diner.sales.order_date<dannys_diner.members.join_date
order by dannys_diner.sales.customer_id,dannys_diner.sales.order_date desc
) as sub
inner join dannys_diner.menu
on sub.product_id=dannys_diner.menu.product_id
where sub.rank=1
group by sub.customer_id,sub.order_date
;
```
Result:

| customer_id | order_date               | aggregated_product_names |
| ----------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| A           | 2021-01-01T00:00:00.000Z | curry, sushi             |
| B           | 2021-01-04T00:00:00.000Z | sushi                    |


8. What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?

```sql
SELECT
dannys_diner.sales.customer_id,
count(dannys_diner.menu.product_id) as total_items,
sum(dannys_diner.menu.price) as total_price
FROM dannys_diner.sales
inner join dannys_diner.members
on dannys_diner.sales.customer_id=dannys_diner.members.customer_id
and dannys_diner.sales.order_date<dannys_diner.members.join_date
inner join dannys_diner.menu
on dannys_diner.sales.product_id=dannys_diner.menu.product_id
group by dannys_diner.sales.customer_id;
```
Result:

| customer_id | total_items | total_price |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| B           | 3           | 40          |
| A           | 2           | 25          |

9.  If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier - how many points would each customer have?

```sql
select
customer_id,
sum(
case when product_name='sushi' then price*2*10
  else price*10 end
) as point
from
dannys_diner.sales
inner join dannys_diner.menu
on dannys_diner.sales.product_id=dannys_diner.menu.product_id
group by customer_id;
```

10. In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date) they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi - how many points do customer A and B have at the end of January?

```sql
select
dannys_diner.sales.customer_id,
sum(
  CASE WHEN order_date <= join_date + INTERVAL '7 days' and order_date >= join_date  THEN price*2*10
    ELSE price*10 END
) AS point
from
dannys_diner.sales
inner join dannys_diner.members
on dannys_diner.sales.customer_id=dannys_diner.members.customer_id
inner join dannys_diner.menu
on dannys_diner.sales.product_id=dannys_diner.menu.product_id
where dannys_diner.sales.order_date < '2021-01-30'
group by dannys_diner.sales.customer_id;
```
